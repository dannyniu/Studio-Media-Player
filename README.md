Studio Media Player
===================

Studio Media Player is my custom Mac app for playing Side-By-Side 3D videos 
in 120fps time-alternating signal format suitable as input for 3D displays 
and projectors that use DLP-Link technology.

This player is meant to be used with screen mode setting tools such as 
[`displayplacer`](https://jakehilborn.github.io/displayplacer/)
