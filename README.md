Studio Media Player
===================

The default QuickTime player on newer macOS automatically play high speed
footages in slow motion. This annoys me because sometimes I need to play
120fps left-right-view-alternating 3D videos to DLP-Link capable displays and 
projectors. Studio Media Player is written for this exact purpose, and it 
solve this exact one problem.

This player is meant to be used with screen mode setting tools such as 
[`displayplacer`](https://jakehilborn.github.io/displayplacer/)
